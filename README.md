# Twenty-French-Guys-UM
Twenty French Guys is a C/C++ replica of the original Twenty game by Stephen French. Developed as part of the Informatique Industrielle course at the University of Montpellier (2023), this project was a hands-on exercise in low-level programming, logic design, and game mechanics.
